# Offset

This crate defines a glorified offset type suitable for arbitrary structs.

I'm way too lazy to say anything more about this right now.

## Licensing

This crate is licensed under both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses, so you are
free to do whatever you want with it as long as you respect the terms from
these two.

If you are a highly paid worker at Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft,
Palantir, Uber, Airbnb, Deliveroo, or any other company that prioritises profit
over people as strongly as they do, you can still use this crate. I simply wish
you will unionise and push back against the obsession for growth, control, and
power that is rampant in your workplace. Please take a stand against the
horrible working conditions they inflict on your lesser paid colleagues, and
more generally their gross disrespect for the very human rights they claim to
fight for.
